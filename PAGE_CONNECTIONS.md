# Page Connections Registry

Tracks how built pages link to each other. Update this file whenever a page is built or navigation changes.

**Legend**

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| CONNECTED | Links to a built page or a real external URL |
| PLANNED | Links via `href()` to `/planned/?path=…` — page exists in sitemap but not built yet |
| MISSING | No link yet — needs a decision (ask the user) |
| N/A | Section has no navigation role |

When asked "what is not connected for X?", read this file plus the `PAGE CONNECTIONS` comment block in that page's HTML.

---

## Tab URLs (site-wide rule)

**Every tab that changes page content must have its own link.** Users must be able to bookmark, share, and arrive from header/footer on the correct tab.

| Requirement | How |
|-------------|-----|
| In-page tabs | `filterTabs` with `syncUrl: true`, `urlBase`, `urlParam` |
| Tab markup | Real `<a href="…">` links (not buttons only) |
| Address bar | Updates on tab click; back/forward works |
| Navigation | Header/footer use the same query params (e.g. `tariffFilterHref('prepaid')`) |
| Docs | List tab URLs under each built page below + inline page comment |

Default pattern: query param on the page path — `/path/?type=value`. "All" = no param.

### Business header (`SITE_CHROME.businessNav`)

Desktop category labels navigate to their landing pages. Hover/focus or the restored adjacent arrow opens the mega menu. Business category links use the same type, height and padding as Personal. Mobile uses a category link plus a separate expand control.

Business uses the approved top-level order: Mobile, Fixed, ICT Solutions, Partnerships, Support and Company. ICT Solutions uses the rail/detail layout for its five third-level groups; the other populated categories use the standard list layout. Campaigns and My Business Wi-Fi are entries under Mobile. Existing campaign detail pages remain reachable through the Campaigns hub.

| Category | Landing / children | Status |
|----------|--------------------|--------|
| Mobile | Tariffs, Internet Packs, Roaming, Mobile Marketing, My Business Wi-Fi, Campaigns, Archive | Roaming, Wi-Fi and Campaigns CONNECTED; other destinations PLANNED |
| Fixed | Internet Leased Line, MPLS / VPN, Fixed connectivity, Managed Wi-Fi | PLANNED |

| Header → Log in | `/business/login/` | PLANNED; final destination pending |
| Header → Contact manager | biznes.azercell.com | CONNECTED (external) |

### Business footer (`SITE_CHROME.businessFooter`)

Uses the responsive Personal footer shell with the same six approved Business groups as the header. ICT Solutions shows its five category landings and every approved child destination in a grouped five-column desktop layout; the same groups expand vertically on mobile. Mobile and the remaining groups list their approved second-level destinations. The Azercell Biznes app banner remains a utility element outside the menu hierarchy. Unknown store destinations remain non-clickable.

Every built Business page also renders its opening hero in the inverse dark theme with light typography, controls and divider lines.

The Business footer connects Campaigns and My Business Wi-Fi under Mobile. Deeper campaign pages remain discoverable from the Campaigns hub instead of the global footer.

## B2B Campaigns — shared connections

All 14 Campaigns routes render the shared Business announcement bar, header, inverse footer and floating bar. Route-specific Campaigns destinations are all built, so `href()` and `registryHref()` resolve them directly. The planned links that remain in the shared Business chrome belong to other unbuilt B2B sections; they continue through `/planned/?path=…` and are not Campaigns gaps.

## Footer (`SITE_CHROME.footer` — B2C Personal)

The Business footer preserves this shell, subscription, legal, social, language and copyright behavior but supplies separate B2B navigation and banners.

## Floating bars (`SITE_CHROME.floatingBar` / `SITE_CHROME.businessFloatingBar`)

Personal keeps Internet, Tariffs, Roaming and Kinon. Business and B2B planned placeholders use Internet, Tariffs, Roaming and Azercell Biznes with B2B destinations. Business popovers omit repeated headings; Roaming adds Turkiye, Georgia and Germany. The Azercell Biznes popover starts with an accented Log in to Azercell Biznes action. Both bars retain Search. On `/join-azercell/transfer-number/` the bar switches to a Start transfer CTA after the hero button scrolls away.

## Gaps worth deciding (ask user before wiring)

| Gap | Question |
|-----|----------|
| `/tariffs/` parent hub | Build hub page, or keep redirecting nav to `/tariffs/mobile/`? |
| Top-level header "Tariffs" item | Add a direct nav item, or keep under Mobile menu only? |
